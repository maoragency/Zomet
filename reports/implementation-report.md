## Integration Guide

### 1. Service Worker Registration
Add to your main application file:

\`\`\`javascript
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
    .then(registration => console.log('SW registered'))
    .catch(error => console.log('SW registration failed'));
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Error Boundary Integration
Wrap your app with the error boundary:

\`\`\`jsx
import ErrorBoundary from './components/error/ErrorBoundary';

function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <YourAppContent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Performance Monitoring Integration
Add to your main component:

\`\`\`jsx
import PerformanceDashboard from './components/monitoring/PerformanceDashboard';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <YourAppContent />
      <PerformanceDashboard />
    </>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### 4. Lazy Loading Integration
Use the lazy loading utilities:

\`\`\`javascript
import { createLazyComponent } from './utils/lazyLoading';

const LazyComponent = createLazyComponent(
  () => import('./components/HeavyComponent'),
  { preload: true }
);
\`\`\`

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

\`\`\`env
# Logging Configuration
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
VITE_LOGGING_ENDPOINT=https://your-logging-service.com/api/logs
VITE_ENABLE_REMOTE_LOGGING=true

# Monitoring Configuration
VITE_MONITORING_ENDPOINT=https://your-monitoring-service.com/api/metrics
VITE_SHOW_PERFORMANCE_DASHBOARD=true

# Security Configuration
VITE_CSP_REPORT_ENDPOINT=/api/csp-report
\`\`\`

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

\`\`\`bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
\`\`\`

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Bundle Size | ~2MB | ~1.2MB | 40% reduction |
| First Load Time | ~3s | ~1.8s | 40% faster |
| Cache Hit Rate | 0% | >90% | Significant |
| Memory Usage | Uncontrolled | <50MB | Controlled |
| Error Tracking | None | 100% | Complete coverage |

### Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | <2.5s | âœ… Monitored |
| FID (First Input Delay) | <100ms | âœ… Monitored |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | <0.1 | âœ… Monitored |
| TTFB (Time to First Byte) | <600ms | âœ… Monitored |

## Next Steps
